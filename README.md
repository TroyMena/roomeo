## Description:
* How many people had a bad roommate? It seems to be ubiquitous in society, and it is a problem we want to help solve so roommates are of utmost compatibility. 
* We developed a web application that has the following:
* (1) a sign-up form to create an account,
* (2) a survey questionaire to list your specifications and preferences,
* (3) An easy-to-use user interface to find your perfect match.

The uniqueness of this application is the length of the survey. The data from each user's survey is displayed on each user profile so that a potential roommate can find their perfect match! 

## User story:

* AS a person looking for a roommate
* I WANT to create a detailed user profile highlighting my preferences, lifestyle, and expectations
* SO THAT I can find a compatible roommate.
